					<p>Badger Clark’s “The Lost Pardner”:

						We loved each other in the way men do						
						And never spoke about it, Al and me,						
						But we both knowed, and knowin’ it so true
						Was more than any woman’s kiss could be.						
						We knowed—and if the way was smooth or rough,						
						The weather shine or pour,						
						While I had him the rest seemed good enough						
						But he ain’t here no more!						
						What is there out beyond the last divide?
						Seems like that country must be cold and dim.
						He’d miss this sunny range he used to ride,
						And he’d miss me, the same as I do him.
						It’s no use thinkin’—all I’d think or say
						Could never make it clear.						
						Out that dim trail that only leads one way						
						He’s gone—and left me here!						
						The range is empty and the trails are blind,						
						And I don’t seem but half myself today.						
						I wait to hear him ridin’ up behind						
						And feel his knee rub mine the good old way.</p>
