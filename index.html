					<p>Welcome to the Lavender Saloon!</p><br>
					<p>"Howdy Pardner, thanks for joining your friend Harry Allen on his journey to the wild west. Harry Allen was born a woman but has unapologetically assumed the name Harry Allen or Harry Livingston throughout his life. You and Harry are looking to buy this haunted saloon, lift the gray objects and let the ghosts of those who owned them tell you their story. After you learn all about them, you can own the saloon, making one of the first LGBTQ+ Saloons that would eventually become the infamous Black Cat Bar".</p>

					<p>Badger Clark’s “The Lost Pardner”:

						We loved each other in the way men do						
						And never spoke about it, Al and me,						
						But we both knowed, and knowin’ it so true
						Was more than any woman’s kiss could be.						
						We knowed—and if the way was smooth or rough,						
						The weather shine or pour,						
						While I had him the rest seemed good enough						
						But he ain’t here no more!						
						What is there out beyond the last divide?
						Seems like that country must be cold and dim.
						He’d miss this sunny range he used to ride,
						And he’d miss me, the same as I do him.
						It’s no use thinkin’—all I’d think or say
						Could never make it clear.						
						Out that dim trail that only leads one way						
						He’s gone—and left me here!						
						The range is empty and the trails are blind,						
						And I don’t seem but half myself today.						
						I wait to hear him ridin’ up behind						
						And feel his knee rub mine the good old way.</p>

					<h1>Congratulations!</h1>
					<p>The Lavender Saloon is in business! In 1906 it will open to become the Black Cat Bar, one of the nations first LGBTQ+ bar. When the state of California tried suspending their liquer license in the 1950's so the owners took the case to the supreme court for discrimination and won their case, regaining their liquer license. This win paved the way to the opening of the Stonewall Inn which pushed forward the Queer liberation movement. You're a part of history!</p>
